# Student Mangement System

This project is a rudimentary Student Management System designed to handle essential student-related information. It provides a set of core functions that allow users to interact with a database (or potentially a simple data structure) through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

#### The key features of this system include the ability to:

**Add student records**: This implies functionality to input and store new student information, likely including details such as name, ID, contact information, and perhaps initial academic details.

**Search student records**: This feature enables users to find specific student information based on certain criteria, such as name or ID.

**Modify student records**: This allows for updating existing student information, enabling corrections or changes to details previously entered.

**Generate mark sheets**: This suggests the system can produce reports or summaries of a student's academic performance, likely including grades or scores for different subjects.

**Delete student records**: This function provides the ability to remove student information from the system.
