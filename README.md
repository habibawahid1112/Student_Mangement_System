# Student Mangement System

This project is a rudimentary Student Management System designed to handle essential student-related information. It provides a set of core functions that allow users to interact with a database (or potentially a simple data structure) through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

üîç Project Purpose
The system is a Java-based desktop application used to:

Manage student records (ID, name, course, subject marks, grades).

Support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Calculate grades automatically.

Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.

Store data persistently using file-based serialization (no SQL DB).
